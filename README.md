Info 343 Final Project
======================

Ideas
-----
Pitch your ideas here:

1. Better schedule finder for classes. The schedule finder that UW has sucks since it barely gives us different
schedules. Usually it's like the same schedule but only one class changes. Create a website that'll actually show
unique schedules.

2. Pet matcher: For people looking to adopt a dog and to people breeding dogs and want to make sure the 
owner is sane enough to have a dog and won't just throw it outside. Probably focus more on matching personalities.
It'll be like a pet social network but not as annoying :)

3. A daily code challenge. Basically make an account, everyday there's a different code challenge (i guess somehow
integrate a compiler? not sure yet) and if the pereson is stumped they can press a button to go to a discussion board
with other people to see their thought process.

4. A pinterest like website but for food. It'll be like a food porn website. It'll have recipes, pictures and howto 
videos. Just a site for food-lovers or people hungry. 

5. A website for a fashion designer. Basically being able to put down information of what kind of style the person likes
to wear and the weather. And then it'll find them an outfit. (this might be hard but it's fun to think about) 

6. Website for people that aren't techy enough and don't know what they want to get (computer wise, tablet wise).
So we all have that friend or know that person that wants to get a laptop but they always get the crappiest one
because they don't know technology. This website will have the different brands of technology in one place and
it'll be categorized by people's rates/reviews. Because not everyone wants to get all technical into hardrive. 
It'll focus on the usability of the technology and basically how long it lasts etc etc. 

AND BAM.

more to come... soon..
